# Basic Concepts

1. `Compiler`:  The code are written in a text archive with ".cpp" extension
2. `Functions`: The language are organized in functions. The main function are an program C++ called `main()`, where the program starts.
3. `Variables`: to define our variables we can use the `int`, `float`, `char`, `double` and `bool`.
4. `Structure Control`: C++ support structure control like conditionals and loops.
