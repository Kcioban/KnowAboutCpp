# Basic Concepts

1. `Compiler`:  The code are written in a text archive with ".cpp" extension
2. `Functions`: The language are organized in functions. The main function are an program C++ called `main()`, where the program starts.
3. `Variables`: to define our variables we can use the `int`, `float`, `char`, `double` and `bool`.
4. `Structure Control`: C++ support structure control like conditionals and loops. Conditionals, like if and else , let you execute different blocks of code based on conditions. Loops, such as for and while , let you repeat blocks of code multiple times.
5. `Arrays`: Arrays are used to store a collection of values ​​of the same type in a single variable. Array elements are accessed using indexes. The index of the first element is 0.
6. `Classes and Objects`: C++ is an object-oriented language, which means that you can use classes and objects to organize your code in a more structured way. A class is a structure that contains data (variables) and functions (methods). An object is an instance of a class.
